* Task 1
We are given:
\[
A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}
\]

And a relation matrix $a$ where $R \subseteq A \times A$:
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\[
a =
 \begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0
 \end{bmatrix}
\]
#+END_EXPORT

We need to find whether relation $a$ is *reflextive*, *symmtetric* and *transitive*, if not then find their *closures* respectively.

** Reflexivity
A relation is *reflexive* if every element is related to itself, e.g., $a_{ii} = 1$ for all $i$.

This means that the diagonal elements are all 1's, but it's not in our case therefore relation $a$ is *not reflexive*.

*** Reflexive Closure
*Reflexive closure* for relation $a$ would be $a_{ref}$ where all the diagonal elements are 1's:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\[
a_{ref} =
 \begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1
 \end{bmatrix}
\]
#+END_EXPORT

** Symmetry
A relation is *symmetric* if $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. \\
We can check this by transposing our relation matrix and if $T(a) = a$ then the relation is *symmetric*:
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\[
T(a) =
 \begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0
 \end{bmatrix}
\]
#+END_EXPORT

We can clearly observe that the transposed matrix differs from the original relation matrix therefore:
\[
T(a) \neq a
\]

So the relation $a$ is *not symmetric*.

*** Symmetric Closure
The *symmetric closure* for relation $a$ would be $a_{sym}$ where every $a_{ij} = a_{ji} = 1$:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\[
a_{sym} =
 \begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1
 \end{bmatrix}
\]
#+END_EXPORT
** Transitivity
A relation is *transitive* if whenever $(i,j) \in R$ and $(j, k) \in R$, then $(i,k) \in R$. \\
We can easily check by taking the *boolean* square of the relation matrix $a$:
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\[
a^2 =
 \begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1
 \end{bmatrix}
\]
#+END_EXPORT

If all the 1's in $a^2$ exists in $a$ then the relation is *transitive*, but this is not the case for us therefore the relation $a$ is *not transitive*.
*** Transitive Closure
We can use Warshall's algorithm to find the transitive closure for relation $a$.
After applying Warshall's algorithm to our initial relation matrix we get:
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\[
a_{trans} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]
#+END_EXPORT

* Task 2
We are asked to find how many integers below or equal to 1000 are divisible by 8, 22 or 32.

Let:
- $A$: Numbers divisible by 8
- $B$: Numbers divisible by 22
- $C$: Numbers divisible by 32

** Calculate the numbers that 1000 is divisible by each number
We start by finding how many nymbers up to 1000 are divisible by: \\

 $8$: Divide 1000 by 8:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{8} \right\rfloor = 125
   \]

 $22$: Divide 1000 by 22:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{22} \right\rfloor = 45
   \]

 $32$: Divide 1000 by 32:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{22} \right\rfloor = 31
   \]

** Substract overlap
Then we will need to subtract the overlap numbers counted twice. \\
Some numbers are disible by both 8 and 22, or 8 and 32, etc. \\
We subtract them so we don't count them twice. \\

To do this, we find how many numbers are divisible by both pairs:
- 8 and 22:
  Find LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 8 and 22
  \[
  LCM(8, 22) = 88
  \]
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{88} \right\rfloor = 11
  \]

- 8 and 32:
  Find LCM of 8 and 32
  \[
  LCM(8, 32) = 32
  \]
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{32} \right\rfloor = 31
  \]

- 22 and 32:
  Find LCM of 22 and 32
  \[
  LCM(22, 32) = 352
  \]
  \[
  \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{352} \right\rfloor = 2
  \]
** Add back numbers counted 3 times
Some numbers are divisible by all three so we add these back because we subtracted them earlier.
- $LCM(8, 22, 32) = 352$
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{1000}{352} \right\rfloor = 2
\]

** Putting it all together using Inclusion-Exclusion Formula
The *Inclusion-Exclusion* Formula states the following:
\[
\left|A \cup B \cup C \right| = \left|A\right| + \left|B\right| + \left|C \right| - \left|A \cap B \right| - \left|A \cap C \right| - \left|B \cap C \right| + \left|A \cap B \cap C \right|
\]

Plug in our values:
- $A = 125$
- $B = 45$
- $C = 31$
- $AB = 11$
- $AC = 31$
- $BC = 2$
- $ABC = 2$

Therefore:
\[
125 + 45 + 31 - 11 - 31 - 2 + 2 = 159
\]

* Task 3
We are given graphs $H$ and $G$:
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth
[[./grappherr.png]]

We must determine if the given graphs are *isomorphic*.
First we recall the definition of two isomorphic graphs: \\

Let $G_1 = (V_1,E_1)$ & $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ be two simple graphs where:
- $V_1, V_2$ are the sets of vertices
- $E_1, E_2$ are the sets of edges

Then $G_1$ & $G_2$ are *isomorphic* if there exists a bijective function $\varphi : V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that:
| $\{u, v\} \in E_1$, if any only if $\{\varphi\left(u\right), \varphi\left(v\right)\} \in E_2$

In simpiler terms $G$ & $H$ are *isomorphic* if there exists a bijection function $\varphi$ that directly maps $G$'s vertices to $H$'s vertices (and vice-versa) and that each degree of both vertices match. \\

In our case it is visually apparent that these two graphs are not *isomorphic*.
More specificaally, the degrees of $u_3, v_3$ do not match, $u_3$ has degree of two while $v_3$ has degree of just one. \\
Therefore these two graphis are not *isomorphic*.
